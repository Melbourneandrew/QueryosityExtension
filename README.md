### How Queryious are you?###
## Find out with queryosity!##

Queryosity is an extension I made because I noticed I took a weird pride in how many google querys I was making per day. The extension also counts querys made with other search engines. Currently supports Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Baidu.

Nothing pertaining to the content of a search is stored, only the date and time is logged to protect user privacy.
