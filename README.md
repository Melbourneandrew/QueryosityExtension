### How Queryious are you?
## Find out with queryosity!

Queryosity is an extension I made because I noticed myself feeling a strange sense of pride for the high number of google querys I make on any given day. Once installed in your browser, Queryosity will start counting the number of querys you are making in a day. Following links and being redirected doesn't count as a 'query'. Only when you enter something in a search engine and are presented with results will a query be tallied. The extension also counts querys made with other search engines. Currently supports Google, Yahoo, Bing, DuckDuckGo, and Baidu.

Nothing pertaining to the content of a search is stored, only the date and time is logged to protect user privacy.
